# ⚃ Mastermind ⚃

should explain

- how an interviewer could run your code
- document your thought process and/or code structure
- describe any creative extensions attempted or implemented

it should be clear and unambiguous in listing all the steps in

- building
- running,
- and playing the game you built (you should make no assumptions about what software the interviewer has, and err on the side of being explicit)

# How to play

To play, please visit this link: https://mastermind-olive.vercel.app/

To run my code locally, you can pull down my repo, cd into web, and do

```
npm run dev
```

to run my test cases

```
npm test
```
